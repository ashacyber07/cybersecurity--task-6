# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

# üéØObjective:
  The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, create multiple passwords with varying complexity, test them using an online password strength checker, and summarize the findings. This     promotes cybersecurity awareness and helps in creating better personal and professional security practices.

  # ‚úÖKey Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords
   * Always use at least 12 characters or more.
   * Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   * Avoid using common words, personal data, or predictable sequences.
   * Create memorable passphrases that are hard for others to guess.
   * Never use the same password for multiple sites or services.
   * Use a password manager to safely generate and store passwords.

# üìö Types of Common Password Attacks
   * Brute Force: Attempts every possible combination until the correct password is found.
   * Dictionary Attack: Tries known words and frequently used passwords.
   * Credential Stuffing: Uses stolen credentials from past breaches to log in elsewhere.
   * Phishing: Tricks users into entering their credentials on fake websites or emails.

# üîê Importance of Password Complexity
  * Weak passwords can be cracked almost instantly.
  * Long and complex passwords are significantly harder to break‚Äîeven with powerful tools.
  * Including a diverse mix of characters boosts protection against automated attacks.
  * Higher complexity minimizes the success chances of brute force or dictionary-based attacks.

# üìÑ Conclusion
   This task provided practical insight into password strength evaluation and highlighted the risks of weak authentication. By applying these best practices, individuals and organizations can improve their          overall cybersecurity defenses and protect against digital threats more effectively.    

# Interview Questions 

# 1. What makes a password strong?
  A strong password is:
    * Long (at least 12‚Äì16 characters)
    * Uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
    * Is unpredictable and does not contain dictionary words
    * Avoids personal information (like names, birthdays)
    * Is unique for each account

# 2. What are common password attacks?
   Some common password attacks include:
    * Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination until it finds the correct one.
    * Dictionary Attack : Uses a list of common words or passwords to guess.
    * Credential Stuffing : Uses leaked credentials from data breaches.
    * Phishing : Tricks users into entering their passwords on fake websites.

# 3. Why is password length important?
  * Longer passwords are **harder to crack** using brute force attacks.
   * Each added character increases the number of possible combinations.
   * A 6-character password can be cracked in seconds, but a 16-character password with complexity can take centuries

# 4. What is a dictionary attack?
   A dictionary attack is a method where attackers:
    * Use a predefined list of words (like from a dictionary or leaked passwords)
    * Try those words as passwords to break into accounts
    * This works well against simple or common passwords like "password123", "admin", etc.

# 5. What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?
 MFA is a security process where:
* You need  two or more verification methods to log in.
  Examples: 
    * Password + OTP (One-Time Password)
    * Password + fingerprint
    * Password + authentication app
    * Even if the password is stolen, MFA **adds an extra layer of protection
  
# 6. How do password managers help?
   Password managers: 
     * Generate strong, unique passwords** for each site
     * Store passwords securely** in encrypted form
     * Auto-fill login forms**, reducing the need to remember complex passwords
     * Help you **avoid reusing passwords**
Popular tools: Bitwarden, LastPass, 1Password, KeePass

# 7. What are passphrases?
   * Passphrases are **long combinations of random words**.
   * Example: BlueTiger!Eats_7BananasDaily
   * They are:
       * Easier to remember
       * Still very secure due to length and randomness
       * More secure than short passwords like Hello123!
  
# 8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
  Common mistakes include:
   * Using short passwords
   * Using personal info (name, DOB)
   * Using common or predictable words (like password,123456)
   *Reusing the same password across multiple accounts
   * Not updating passwords after a data breach
